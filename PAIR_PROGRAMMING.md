Hangperson: pair programming thoughts
=====================================

I had fun doing pair programming. However, I believe that two people are doing the job of one and they should be “paid half”, plus also spending time for discussions - not something you can afford in a workaday mad rush. Pair programming adds extra time, while only guaranteeing the code quality of best developer of two.
